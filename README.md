# Drug-Review-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on classifying drug reviews using machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment of user reviews. By analyzing text data from drug reviews, the model aims to classify them into categories such as positive, neutral, and negative. This can help in understanding public opinion and experiences regarding various medications, assisting healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies in improving their products and services.
