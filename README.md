# Drug-Review-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on classifying drug reviews using machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment of user reviews. By analyzing text data from drug reviews, the model aims to classify them into categories such as positive, neutral, and negative. This can help in understanding public opinion and experiences regarding various medications, assisting healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies in improving their products and services.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis, including tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming.
- Feature Extraction: Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
- Model Training: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train the sentiment classification model.
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Visualization: Generating visualizations to understand the distribution of sentiments and the effectiveness of the classification model.
